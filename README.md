# Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains the machine learning model for the "Rock vs Mine Prediction" project, developed by Vineet Kunder, Pranali Vishe, and Himaja Dudhal. This project was submitted to the University of Mumbai in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Third Year Engineering in Information Technology.

### Abstract
The "Rock vs Mine Prediction" utilizes machine learning to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar signal data. Employing Logistic Regression optimized through feature selection, the project has achieved an accuracy of 76.19%. This work demonstrates the significant potential of machine learning in enhancing the detection of underwater objects, contributing to safer navigation in maritime operations.

### Motivation
The primary aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether an underwater object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. This capability is crucial for military submarines to navigate safely through potentially hazardous waters.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the required packages as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 
Run the prediction script with the following command to classify sonar signals:

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled sonar signals collected from various underwater settings, distinguishing between echoes from rocks and mines.
